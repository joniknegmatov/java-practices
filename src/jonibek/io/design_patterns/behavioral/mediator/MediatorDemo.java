/**
 * Mediator pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes.
 * This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the communications between different
 * classes and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling. Mediator pattern falls under behavioral
 * pattern category.
 *
 * Implementation
 * We are demonstrating mediator pattern by example of a chat room where multiple users can send message
 * to chat room and it is the responsibility of chat room to show the messages to all users. We have created
 * two classes ChatRoom and User. User objects will use ChatRoom method to share their messages.
 *
 * MediatorPatternDemo, our demo class, will use User objects to show communication between them.
