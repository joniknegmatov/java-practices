/**
 * Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between
 * objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are
 * to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
 *
 * Implementation
 * Observer pattern uses three actor classes. Subject, Observer and Client.
 * Subject is an object having methods to attach and detach observers to a client object.
 * We have created an abstract class Observer and a concrete class Subject that is extending class Observer.
 *
 * ObserverPatternDemo, our demo class, will use Subject and concrete class object to show observer
 * pattern in action.
