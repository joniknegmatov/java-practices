/**
 * Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and
 * to decrease memory footprint and increase performance. This type of design pattern
 * comes under structural pattern as this pattern provides ways to decrease object count
 * thus improving the object structure of application.
 *
 * Flyweight pattern tries to reuse already existing similar kind objects by storing them
 * and creates new object when no matching object is found. We will demonstrate this pattern
 * by drawing 20 circles of different locations but we will create only 5 objects. Only 5 colors
 * are available so color property is used to check already existing Circle objects.
 *
 * Implementation
 * We are going to create a Shape interface and concrete class Circle implementing the Shape interface.
 * A factory class ShapeFactory is defined as a next step.
 *
 * ShapeFactory has a HashMap of Circle having key as color of the Circle object. Whenever a request
 * comes to create a circle of particular color to ShapeFactory, it checks the circle object in its HashMap,
 * if object of Circle found, that object is returned otherwise a new object is created, stored in hashmap
 * for future use, and returned to client.
 *
 * FlyWeightPatternDemo, our demo class, will use ShapeFactory to get a Shape object. It will pass
 * information (red / green / blue/ black / white) to ShapeFactory to get the circle of desired color it needs.
