/**
 * Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
 * This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.
 *
 * This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality
 * keeping class methods signature intact.
 *
 * We are demonstrating the use of decorator pattern via following example in which we will decorate a shape with
 * some color without alter shape class.
 *
 * Implementation
 * We're going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing the Shape interface. We will then
 * create an abstract decorator class ShapeDecorator implementing the Shape interface and having Shape object
 * as its instance variable.
 *
 * RedShapeDecorator is concrete class implementing ShapeDecorator.
 *
 * DecoratorPatternDemo, our demo class will use RedShapeDecorator to decorate Shape objects.
